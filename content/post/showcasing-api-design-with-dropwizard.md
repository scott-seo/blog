I have been working on API design and micro services for over two years. I have created DVD Store API for showcasing API design and DevOps discipline. 
Click on my [github](https://github.com/scott-seo/dvdstore-api) page for summary of what I have built.

### Evolution over revolution
I had the pleasure of sitting in go training class from ArdanLabs. 
Once thing that was mentioned in the class is incrementally deploying your changes. 
We all know this and but we often get overexcited about coding everything and including everything.
I am ripping out stuff that's not in use in my commons package as of today.

### Monolithic vs micro services
1 things I wish I knew when I first started building micro services is start slow and start with monolithic then break modules out to their own API.
There is cost associated with building micro services.

    May the peace be with you
